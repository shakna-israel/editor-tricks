Tricks to get you a text editor when nothing else is working.

---

A few short scripts that will give you a *very* basic file editing experience, just in case the normal *edit*, *notepad*, *vi*, *editor* commands aren't linked up to anything. (Yay for embedded systems!)

For Windows-based systems, before checking out [winvim.bat](winvim.bat), try typing *edit* at the commandline. The systems without it are few and far between. Its pretty full-featured too.
